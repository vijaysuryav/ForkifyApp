## Project: Forkify Recipe Application

### Description:
Forkify is a modern web application designed to search, view, and manage recipes. It allows users to search for recipes from an external API, view detailed recipe instructions, adjust serving sizes dynamically, bookmark favorite recipes, and even upload custom recipes. The project demonstrates expertise in JavaScript (ES6+), asynchronous programming, modular architecture, and state management.

### Key Features:
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for recipes using keywords. Results are fetched asynchronously from an external API and displayed with pagination for better navigation.
- **Recipe Details:** Clicking on a recipe displays detailed instructions, ingredients, and cooking steps. Users can dynamically adjust the number of servings.
- **Bookmarks:** Recipes can be bookmarked for quick access. Bookmarks are stored in local storage to persist across sessions.
- **Custom Recipe Upload:** Users can add their own recipes through a form. The new recipe is validated and uploaded to the server.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices.

### Technical Highlights:
1. **Architecture:**
   - Followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for clean code organization.
   - Modular JavaScript design using ES6 modules.
   - Centralized state management in the `model.js` file to handle recipe data, search results, and bookmarks.

2. **Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Used `async/await` for fetching data from an external API.
   - Implemented error handling for failed API requests or invalid user inputs.

3. **Dynamic Rendering:**
   - Leveraged DOM manipulation to render search results, recipe details, pagination buttons, and bookmarks dynamically.
   - Used reusable view classes (e.g., `RecipeView`, `SearchView`) for rendering UI components.

4. **Local Storage Integration:**
   - Bookmarked recipes are saved in local storage to ensure persistence across browser sessions.

5. **Event Handling:**
   - Implemented event delegation to handle user interactions like searching, selecting a recipe, pagination clicks, bookmarking, and uploading recipes.

### Workflow Overview:
- **Search Recipes:** User searches → Results loaded asynchronously → Rendered with pagination.
- **View Recipe Details:** User selects a recipe → Recipe data fetched → Rendered dynamically.
- **Bookmark Recipes:** User bookmarks a recipe → Stored in local storage → Bookmark list updated.
- **Upload Recipes:** User uploads a new recipe → Validated and sent to API → Added to state and rendered.

### Technologies Used:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Webpack (for bundling)
- Babel (for transpiling)
- External Recipe API

### Challenges Overcome:
- Implementing efficient state management to handle multiple features like search results, bookmarks, and user-uploaded recipes.
- Ensuring seamless user experience with asynchronous data loading and error handling.
- Designing a scalable architecture using the MVC pattern.

### Outcome:
The Forkify project showcases my ability to build feature-rich web applications with modern JavaScript practices. It highlights my skills in asynchronous programming, modular architecture, state management, and creating responsive user interfaces. This project is an excellent example of my proficiency in building interactive applications that prioritize performance and usability.
